# AnkiTemplate

This template is a work in progress. I was seeing a lot of people struggling to make an easy template. Who wants to waste time coding when you just want a template to use.

Features
- Deck Supports Furigana
- Meaning is Hidden to let you guess (click on it display)
- Expression gets fed to Jisho.org or Jpdb.io for breakdown

That being said there are some very specific things you need to do when filling out the cards.

さあ、始めましょう！

There are 4 fields in the structure. it is important when creating the cards you either paste it in notepad or use the </> button to add it the text without formatting (Anki tends to do that)

- Word: The word that you want learn
- Expression: Write a sentence with that word (Supports Furigana, see below how to do it)
- Reading: Reading of the expression This is where the magic will happen. In order to add the furigana you will need to add the sentence like so 
毎日[まいにち]、 日本語[にほんご]を 勉強[べんきょう]している
the [] are where you place the furigana.

!Important the brackets need to be with an EN Keyboard  
!Important The spaces between words have to be a Half width space (standard on English Keyboard forJP IME ones Shift + space makes a half width space) this is important cause the formatting will break

Meaning: What does the word mean

!Note This Deck uses Standard Yu Mincho Font

Learning with sentences and context is one of the best ways imo, I hope this helps you all.
Feel free to modify this as you please!
Happy Learning
